# kickstarter-analysis.
In this project we look at data from various kickstarter campaigns across different countries and categories to help Louise start her campaign.
## findings.
*Compared to other categories, theatre based campaigns have the greatest proportion of successful campaigns.![graph1](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-1.png)
*There were 893 out of 1393 theatre campaigns that were successful in the United States.
*493/1393 theatre campaigns failed and did not meet its fundraising goal and a very small portion of campaigns in the dataset were cancelled or are still live.![graph3](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-3.png)
*Within theatre campaigns, plays are the most likely type of campaign to be successfully funded.![graph4](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-4.png)
*Based on the date of launch, campaigns launched in May-June are more successful than those launched towards the end of the year.![graph2](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-2.png)
*The mean goal of most successful play campaigns in Great Britain is around $5,049 while the mean of failed campaigns is much higher at $10.554. However there is also a huge difference between the mean pledged amount for successful and failed campaigns suggesting it is not just the higher asking price of failed campaigns that contributes to their failure.
*In fact, the 75th percentile of the goal and pledged amounts coincide quite closely with the mean values of this data suggesting that there is greater variation in the dataset.

Based on my findings, I recommend Louise launch her theatre kickstarter campaign in May of the year requesting between $5,000-$10,000 to start. 

### challenge.
*Based on analysis of outcomes for theatre/play kickstarter campaigns, the highest percentage of successful kickstarter campaigns have a starting goal ask between 1000-5000 with the highest percentage of failure occuring at the highest end of the spectrum between 45000-49000.![graph2](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-6.png)
*By filtering the launch date data we see that the most successful plays launch in the month of May. ![graph2](jennitian/module-1/data-1 graph-7.png)

Based on this data we would assume that by setting a moderate goal on kickstarter, plays are more likely to be successfully funded. Plays that asked for greater than 40,000 as a starting goal have also seen success, however, there are fewer than 20 data points on plays with a starting goal in this range, so it's difficult to predict what kind of factors contributed to their success or failure.  Furthermore, based on launch date I would conclude launching in May has the highest chance of success. 

There are limitations to these findings. As mentioned above, there are fewer data points on the higher goal asks. Therefore, we can't be certain that the data is representative of a typical outcome for a kickstarter play asking for over 40,000 or if the sample size is too small and therefore skewed. Furthermore, this data only accounts for all the plays included in this dataset and does not take into account factors like when in the lifecycle of the play the kickstarter was started, the type of play, and whether further fundraising campaigns were conducted for the same plays with lower asking amounts and whether those subsequent campaignswere successful.

Moving forward, further breakdown of the analysis into genres of play to see whether certain types of plays are more likely to be funded would be useful. It may also be helpful to account for the deadline of campaigns as a shorter amount of time may account for more failures across higher goal amounts. As for the date of launch data, it may be useful to compare kickstarter website usership data with the launch date success graph. If website usership is normally low in December/January due to the holiday seasons, this could account for the lowest amount of success in the months of January/December.
