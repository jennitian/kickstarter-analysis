# kickstarter-analysis.
In this project we look at data from various kickstarter campaigns across different countries and categories to help Louise start her campaign.
## findings.
Compared to other categories, theatre based campaigns have the greatest proportion of successful campaigns.![graph1](module-1/data-1 graph-1.png)
There were 893 out of 1393 theatre campaigns that were successful in the United States.
493/1393 theatre campaigns failed and did not meet its fundraising goal and a very small portion of campaigns in the dataset were cancelled or are still live.![graph3](module-1/data-1 graph-3.png)
Within theatre campaigns, plays are the most likely type of campaign to be successfully funded.![graph4](module-1/data-1 graph-4.png)
Based on the date of launch, campaigns launched in May-June are more successful than those launched towards the end of the year. [graph2](module-1/data-1 graph-2.png)
The mean goal of most successful play campaigns in Great Britain is around $5,049 while the mean of failed campaigns is much higher at $10.554. However there is also a huge difference between the mean pledged amount for successful and failed campaigns suggesting it is not just the higher asking price of failed campaigns that contributes to their failure.
In fact, the 75th percentile of the goal and pledged amounts coincide quite closely with the mean values of this data suggesting that there is more variation in the dataset.

Based on my findings, I recommend Louise launch her theatre kickstarter campaign in May of the year requesting between $5,000-$10,000 to start.
